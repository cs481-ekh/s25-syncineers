# Easy Sync

## Abstract:
Boise State University administrators currently spend hours manually inputting class schedules from PeopleSoft Campus Solutions into Google Calendar due to format incompatibilities. Our solution automates this process by transforming PeopleSoft data into a Google Calendar-friendly format. Additionally, our solution allows administrators to assign schedules to specific Google Calendars, ensuring proper organization with ease. By streamlining this process, our tool will significantly reduce data entry time for the Geosciences department and possibly provide a solution for other university departments.
